In this project, I worked with restaurant sales data to solve some key issues affecting the business. The restaurant was struggling with understanding which menu items were performing well, managing orders efficiently, and predicting sales trends.

To improve the menu, I looked at the most and least expensive items and analyzed pricing trends. This helped the management understand which items were popular and which ones werenâ€™t, allowing them to focus on the best sellers and consider changing or removing underperforming dishes.

I also helped improve sales strategies by looking at how much money each menu category was bringing in and tracking sales patterns over time. This gave the restaurant better insights into daily sales changes and helped them plan promotions, discounts, and manage inventory more effectively. By using data, the restaurant was able to make smarter decisions to increase profitability and run more efficiently.
